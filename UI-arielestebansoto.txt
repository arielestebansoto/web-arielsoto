DARK THEME
The recommended dark theme surface color is #121212
background #202124
white #e8eaed

Icon sizes

When creating an icon, view and edit it at 400% (192 x 192 dp), which will display edges at 4dp. By maintaining this ratio, any changes to the original will be scaled up or down proportionally, which preserves sharp edges and correct alignment when the scale is returned to 100% (48dp).
